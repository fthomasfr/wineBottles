#Linux Wine Bottles utils

This repository gathers scripts to manage Linux Wine Bottles.

It has been enhanced from the original one available [here](http://linux-tipps.blogspot.fr/2009/03/how-to-make-your-own-wine-bottles.html)

I use it to install [microsoft office on linux Ubuntu](http://www.wine-reviews.net/wine-reviews/applications/how-to-install-microsoft-office-2010-on-linux-with-wine.html).

* `winebottle --list` to list the available bottles
* `winebottle --conf "MyBottleName"` to configure the bottle (it calls winecfg)
* `winebottle --tricks "MyBottleName"` to configure the bottle install (it calls winetricks)
* `wine myapplication` to run an application
